Subject: Request for Temporary Remote Work Arrangement - Personal Medical Reason

Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to request a temporary remote work arrangement due to a personal medical reason concerning a family member. While the situation is not severe enough to cause alarm, it does require my presence and assistance at home during this time.

I want to assure you that I remain committed to fulfilling my responsibilities and maintaining a high level of productivity. In light of the circumstances, I believe that continuing to work from home would enable me to manage the situation effectively while contributing to the team's objectives.

Although I am unable to provide specific details about the nature of the medical issue due to privacy considerations, I can assure you that it requires regular attention and support. By working remotely, I will be able to closely monitor the situation, provide the necessary care, and ensure a smooth recovery process for my family member. I have already made arrangements to ensure that my work environment at home is conducive to productivity, with all the necessary resources and technology readily available.

I understand the importance of maintaining a cohesive and efficient team, and I am confident that my remote work arrangement will not hinder my ability to collaborate effectively with my colleagues. I will be accessible during regular working hours via email, phone, and any other communication platforms our team utilizes. Furthermore, I will be proactive in providing regular updates on my progress and availability to ensure transparency and ease of coordination.

I kindly request your understanding and support in granting me this temporary remote work arrangement. I am confident that by working from home, I will be able to continue delivering high-quality work and contribute to the team's success without compromising any deadlines or objectives. I am more than willing to discuss any concerns or adjustments that may arise as a result of this arrangement.

Thank you for your consideration and support during this time. I remain fully committed to the team's goals and will do my utmost to ensure a seamless workflow. Please let me know if there are any further details or documentation required to facilitate this request. I appreciate your understanding and assistance.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
[Your Position/Title]
